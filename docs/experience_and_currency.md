# Experience (XP) and Gold

This document explains the two primary player currencies in the game: Experience Points (XP) and Gold.

## Experience Points (XP)

XP is a measure of your character's growth and combat prowess. It is primarily earned by defeating enemies in battle.

### Earning XP

The main way to earn XP is by defeating enemies. The amount of XP awarded is based on the enemy's level, using the default formula:

`XP Gained = Enemy Level Ã— 10`

### Spending XP

XP is a valuable currency used to acquire permanent enhancements for your character. You can spend XP on:

*   **Blessings:** Powerful, persistent boons.
*   **Permanent Upgrades:** Stat increases and other permanent character improvements.

These can be purchased from the shop.

## Gold

Gold remains the primary currency for purchasing consumable items and other temporary or single-use goods from the shop. Use Gold for things like:

*   Potions
*   Scrolls
*   Other one-time use items.
